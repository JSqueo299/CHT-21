abstract = {Formation of soot and NO in counterflow ethylene/oxygen/nitrogen diffusion flames was numerically investigated. Detailed chemistry and complex thermal and transport properties were used. A simplified two-equation soot model was adopted. The results indicate that NO emission has negligible influence on soot formation. However, soot formation affects the emission of NO through the radiation induced thermal effect and the reaction induced chemical effect. When the oxygen index of the oxidant stream is lower, the relative influence of chemical reaction caused by soot on NO emission is more important, while the relative influence of the radiation induced thermal effect becomes more important for the flame with a higher oxygen index in the oxidant stream. {\textcopyright} 2004 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Communication through e-mails remains to be highly formalized, conventional and indispensable method for the exchange of information over the Internet. An ever-increasing ratio and adversary nature of spam e-mails have posed a great many challenges such as uneven class distribution, unequal error cost, frequent change of content and personalized context-sensitive discrimination. In this research, we propose a novel and distinctive approach to develop an incremental personalized e-mail spam filter. The proposed work is described using three significant contributions. First, we applied a novel term frequency difference and category ratio based feature selection function TFDCR to select the most discriminating features irrespective of the number of samples in each class. Second, an incremental learning model is used which enables the classifier to update the discriminant function dynamically. Third, a heuristic function called selectionRankWeight is introduced to upgrade the existing feature set that determines new features carrying strong discriminating ability from an incoming set of e-mails. Three public e-mail datasets possessing different characteristics are used to evaluate the filter performance. Experiments are conducted to compare the feature selection efficiency of TFDCR and to observe the filter performance under both the batch and the incremental learning mode. The results demonstrate the superiority of TFDCR as the most effective feature selection function. The incremental learning model incorporating dynamic feature update function overcomes the problem of drifting concepts. The proposed filter validates its efficiency and feasibility by substantially improving the classification accuracy and reducing the false positive error of misclassifying legitimate e-mail as spam.}

With the advance of Machine Learning (ML) technology, the big data from CFD results can be intelligently recognized and classified, thus ease the data post-processing. This study proposed an integrated analysis that uses CFD simulation results of scalar distributions and K-means clustering algorithm to optimally partition engine combustion chamber into different zones. Therefore, the space of combustion chamber was automatically divided into light soot zones and heavy soot zones based on the clustering results on local equivalence ratio (ER) and temperature. Consequently, the surveys of soot mitigation by Reactivity Controlled Compression Ignition (RCCI) engines combustion mode were carried out as well as corresponding sooting tendency by CFD numerical study. The localized soot depositions in each zone under varied combustion boundaries were compared, hence improving the development of control strategy with numerical modellings and machine learning techniques.}

abstract = {Among patients with Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the ability to identify patients at risk for deterioration during their hospital stay is essential for effective patient allocation and management. To predict patient risk for critical COVID-19 based on status at admission using machine-learning models. Retrospective study based on a database of tertiary medical center with designated departments for patients with COVID-19. Patients with severe COVID-19 at admission, based on low oxygen saturation, low partial arterial oxygen pressure, were excluded. The primary outcome was risk for critical disease, defined as mechanical ventilation, multi-organ failure, admission to the ICU, and/or death. Three different machine-learning models were used to predict patient deterioration and compared to currently suggested predictors and to the APACHEII risk-prediction score. Among 6995 patients evaluated, 162 were hospitalized with non-severe COVID-19, of them, 25 (15.4{\%}) patients deteriorated to critical COVID-19. Machine-learning models outperformed the all other parameters, including the APACHE II score (ROC AUC of 0.92 vs. 0.79, respectively), reaching 88.0{\%} sensitivity, 92.7{\%} specificity and 92.0{\%} accuracy in predicting critical COVID-19. The most contributory variables to the models were APACHE II score, white blood cell count, time from symptoms to admission, oxygen saturation and blood lymphocytes count. Machine-learning models demonstrated high efficacy in predicting critical COVID-19 compared to the most efficacious tools available. Hence, artificial intelligence may be applied for accurate risk prediction of patients with COVID-19, to optimize patients triage and in-hospital allocation, better prioritization of medical resources and improved overall management of the COVID-19 pandemic.},

@article{Ahamad2020,
abstract = {The recent outbreak of the respiratory ailment COVID-19 caused by novel coronavirus SARS-Cov2 is a severe and urgent global concern. In the absence of effective treatments, the main containment strategy is to reduce the contagion by the isolation of infected individuals; however, isolation of unaffected individuals is highly undesirable. To help make rapid decisions on treatment and isolation needs, it would be useful to determine which features presented by suspected infection cases are the best predictors of a positive diagnosis. This can be done by analyzing patient characteristics, case trajectory, comorbidities, symptoms, diagnosis, and outcomes. We developed a model that employed supervised machine learning algorithms to identify the presentation features predicting COVID-19 disease diagnoses with high accuracy. Features examined included details of the individuals concerned, e.g., age, gender, observation of fever, history of travel, and clinical details such as the severity of cough and incidence of lung infection. We implemented and applied several machine learning algorithms to our collected data and found that the XGBoost algorithm performed with the highest accuracy ({\textgreater}85{\%}) to predict and select features that correctly indicate COVID-19 status for all age groups. Statistical analyses revealed that the most frequent and significant predictive symptoms are fever (41.1{\%}), cough (30.3{\%}), lung infection (13.1{\%}) and runny nose (8.43{\%}). While 54.4{\%} of people examined did not develop any symptoms that could be used for diagnosis, our work indicates that for the remainder, our predictive model could significantly improve the prediction of COVID-19 status, including at early stages of infection.},

abstract = {Across the world's coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hot spots, the need to streamline patient diagnosis and management has become more pressing than ever. As one of the main imaging tools, chest X-rays (CXRs) are common, fast, noninvasive, relatively cheap, and potentially bedside to monitor the progression of the disease. This paper describes the first public COVID-19 image data collection as well as a preliminary exploration of possible use cases for the data. This dataset currently contains hundreds of frontal view X-rays and is the largest public resource for COVID-19 image and prognostic data, making it a necessary resource to develop and evaluate tools to aid in the treatment of COVID-19. It was manually aggregated from publication figures as well as various web based repositories into a machine learning (ML) friendly format with accompanying dataloader code. We collected frontal and lateral view imagery and metadata such as the time since first symptoms, intensive care unit (ICU) status, survival status, intubation status, or hospital location. We present multiple possible use cases for the data such as predicting the need for the ICU, predicting patient survival, and understanding a patient's trajectory during treatment.

Many of these basic principles are very familiar to the pharmacometrics and clinical pharmacology community. In this paper, we want to introduce the foundational ideas of ML to this community such that readers obtain the essential tools they need to understand publications on the topic.

@article{Alexander2018,
abstract = {Soot emissions from combustion devices are known to have harmful effects on the environment and human health. As the transportation industry continues to expand, the development of techniques to reduce soot emissions remains a significant goal of researchers and industry. In order for current soot modeling techniques to be reliably accurate, they must incur an intractably high computational cost. This project leverages existing knowledge in soot modeling and soot formation fundamentals to develop a stand-alone, computationally inexpensive soot concentration estimator to be linked to Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations as a post-processor. Preliminary development and testing of the estimator is presented here for laminar flames. As soot properties cannot be determined by local conditions, the estimator consists of a library generated using the hystereses of soot-containing fluid parcels, which relates soot concentration to the aggregated gas-phase environment histories to which a fluid parcel has been exposed. The estimator can be used to relate soot concentration to computed parcel hystereses through interpolation techniques. The estimator shows the potential ability to produce accurate results with very low computational cost in laminar coflow diffusion flames. Results also show that as flame data representing a broader set of conditions (temperature, mixture fraction, residence time, etc.) are added to the library, the estimator becomes applicable to a wider range of flames.},

abstract = {Soot formation modeling, when incorporated into computational fluid dynamics of industrial devices, can be numerically prohibitive. Nonetheless, there remains a significant push to predict soot formation, so as to aid in environmentally sustainable design. The present work features a redesign of an inexpensive soot estimator, that has been developed and applied to laminar flames with great success. It is much more accurate and efficient than previous versions. The soot estimator consists of a library generated from validated sooting flame models, in which the Lagrangian histories of soot-containing fluid parcels are stored. The library is used in post-processing to estimate soot concentrations. For the first time, the estimator framework is used to predict the entire soot field. Also, important parameters to the estimator technique are analyzed. This work is conducted for nine different sooting ethylene/air coflow diffusion flames. The framework successfully predicts the entire soot field. When the data from many flames were combined into one library based on mixture fraction, temperature, and (Formula presented.) histories, it could predict all flames with high accuracy. Finally, two scenarios were considered to assess the framework with an independent set of data, and the predictor presented very good accuracy in capturing soot formation.},

Using a training dataset of images of flames captured in laboratory conditions and labeled according to Line-Of-Sight Attenuation (LOSA) measurements, we trained different classifiers for deter- mining the soot propensity of flames using images in a testing dataset. We evaluate a traditional classifier based on Support Vector Machine (SVM), combined with dimensionality reduction techniques and compare the results with different architectures of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Experimental results in terms of classification performance and inference time set the proposed classifiers as a promising solution for non-invasive and low-cost instrumentation for characterizing the status of combustion flames in industrial settings.},

abstract = {The use of oxygenated components is an effective way to suppress soot formation and reduce particulate matter emission in diesel engines. Based on the group additivity method, we proposed a new statistical model with kernel ridge regression (KRR) to predict the sooting tendencies of oxygenated components and interpret the experimental results of fuel sooting tendency. Through a training process, the relationship between fuel molecular structure and sooting tendency was built. In the testing process, the predicted values of the yield sooting index were in good agreement with the measured values, indicating that the KRR model had good predictive performance. The KRR method can be used to compare the sooting tendencies of various components that are important in traditional or new fuels. For example, based on the predicted results of typical five-carbon oxygenated compounds, the inhibiting effects of oxygen functional groups on sooting tendency are in the following order: esters > ketones ≈ aldehydes > ethers > alcohols. In addition, the proposed method provides statistical evidence for the effects of structural features on sooting tendencies. The predictive results for typical ethers indicate that although sooting tendencies increase as carbon chains become more branched, they are not very sensitive to the specific arrangement of the branches compared with the effect of carbon chain length. Moreover, the KRR method is useful for studying non-nearest-neighbor interactions, including functional group interactions. By predicting the sooting tendencies of typical esters, the coupling of ester moiety and CC double bonds shows an overall enhancing effect on sooting tendency, which indicates that CC double bonds play a dominant role in soot formation. This method provides an alternative way to obtain the sooting tendencies of fuel compounds and verifies the selection of low-sooting fuels from a wide range of feedstocks.}

A method to evaluate the radiative heat source, required by the overall energy equation, is also developed.

The flames have been investigated with laser diagnostics. Laser extinction has been used to calibrate the experimental soot volume fractions and an improved gating method has been implemented in the laser-induced incandescence (LII) measurements resulting in differences to the soot distributions reported previously. Numerical simulations have been based on a fully coupled solution of the flow conservation equations, gas-phase species conservation equations with complex chemistry, and the dynamical equations for soot spheroid growth. The model also includes the effects of radiation reabsorption through an iterative procedure. An investigation of the computed rates of particle inception, surface growth, and oxidation, along with a residence time analysis, helps to explain the shift in the peak soot volume fraction from the centerline to the wings of the flame as the fuel fraction increases. The shift arises from changes in the relative importance of inception and surface growth combined with a significant increase in the residence time within the annular soot formation field leading to higher soot volume fractions, as the fuel fraction increases.}

The review first demonstrates the intricacies of chemical kinetics in homogeneous and diffusive systems, and emphasizes the essential importance of the comprehensiveness of chemical fidelity for mechanisms at the detailed and reduced levels. A systematic approach towards developing detailed reaction mechanisms is then outlined, followed by an extensive discussion on the development of reduced mechanisms and the associated strategies towards facilitated computation. Topics covered include skeletal reduction especially through directed relation graph; time-scale reduction based on the concepts of quasi-steady species enabled through computational singular perturbation; the lumping of isomers and of species with similar diffusivities; on-the-fly stiffness removal; the relative merits of implicit versus explicit solvers; and computation cost minimization achieved through tabulation and the judicious re-sequencing of the computational steps in arithmetic evaluations. Examples are given for laminar flames and direct numerical simulations of turbulent combustion to demonstrate the utility of the integrated strategy and the component methods in incorporating realistic chemistry of practical fuels in large-scale simulations, recognizing that the detailed mechanisms of these fuels may consist of hundreds to thousands of species and thousands to tens of thousands of reactions. Directions for further research are suggested.}

abstract = {A sparse stiff chemistry solver based on dynamic adaptive hybrid integration (AHI-S) is developed and demonstrated for efficient combustion simulations. In a previous study, a dynamic adaptive method for hybrid integration (AHI) was developed to speed up the time integration of chemically reacting flows with detailed chemistry. The AHI method solves the fast subcomponent of chemistry implicitly and the slow subcomponent of chemistry and transport explicitly, and it was shown that AHI is more accurate and efficient than the operator-splitting schemes when there are significant radical sources from the transport term. In the present study, the AHI method is first improved to minimize the number of nontrivial entries in the Jacobian. Sparse matrix techniques are further integrated into AHI to achieve high computational efficiency. The performance of the new AHI-S solver is investigated in constant-pressure auto-ignition systems using different mechanisms that consist of 9–2878 species. It is shown that the computational cost of the AHI-S solver is overall linearly proportional to the mechanism size and is comparable to that of evaluating reaction rates using CHEMKIN-II subroutines. The AHI-S solver achieves speed-up factors ranging from approximately 10, for the 9-species hydrogen mechanism, to approximately 3000, for the 2878-species biodiesel mechanism, compared with the fully implicit VODE solver with Jacobian evaluated through numerical perturbations and factorized with dense matrix operations. It is further found that for mechanisms with less than approximately 100 species, the time saving of AHI-S is primarily attributed to the reduced size of the implicit core of the governing equations, while for mechanisms with more than 100 species, the computational cost of VODE is dominated by the dense LU factorization, such that the time saving of AHI-S is mostly attributed to the sparse LU factorization. The AHI-S solver is then applied to unsteady perfectly stirred reactors involving extinction and re-ignition. Speed-up factors from 50 to 30,000 are achieved compared with the Strang splitting scheme with the chemistry substeps implicitly integrated with VODE, while speed-up factors of 10–100 are achieved compared with the Strang splitting scheme implemented with the sparse stiff LSODES solver. In the end, the performance of AHI-S is investigated in one-dimensional (1-D) unsteady freely propagating laminar premixed flames for a methane/air mixture, for which the time step size in AHI-S is limited by the fastest transport process. A speed-up factor of approximately 200 is achieved compared with the Strang splitting scheme for fixed time step sizes between 10−8s and 10−6s.}

The importance of changes in the particle residence time, flame geometry and growth rates are evaluated as a function of fuel flow rate. Emphasis is given to the soot volume fraction measurements in two characteristic regions of the flame: the annular region near the flame front where soot is first observed to form, and the center line of the flame. In the annular region, increases in the residence time with increasing fuel flow rate are found to be the major reason for increased soot formation.

abstract = {A recently developed chemical kinetic scheme for C2 fuel combustion with PAH growth has been implemented in a parallelized coflow flame solver. The reaction mechanism has been developed to include almost all reasonably well-established reaction classes for aromatic ring formation and soot particle precursor molecular weight growth. The model has recently been validated for zero- and one-dimensional premixed flame systems [N.A. Slavinskaya, P. Frank, Combust. Flame 156 (2009) 1705–1722] and has now been updated and extended to a sooting ethylene/air diffusion flame in the coflow geometry. Updates to the mechanism reflect the latest advances in the literature and address numerical stiffness that was present in diffusion flame systems. The chemical kinetic mechanism has been coupled to a sectional aerosol dynamics model for soot growth, considering PAH-based inception and surface condensation, surface chemistry (growth and oxidation), coagulation, and fragmentation. The sectional model predicts the soot aggregate number density and the number of primary particles per aggregate in each section, so as to yield information on particle size distribution and structure. Flame simulation data for the present mechanism is compared to data computed using two other reaction schemes [J. Appel, H. Bockhorn, M. Frenklach, Combust. Flame 121 (2000) 122–136; N.M. Marinov, W.J. Pitz, C.K. Westbrook, A.M. Vincitore, M.J. Castaldi, S.M. Senkan, Combust. Flame 114 (1998) 192–213]. The computed data are also compared to numerous experimental data sets. Whereas the fuel oxidation chemistry in all three mechanisms are essentially the same, the PAH growth pathways vary considerably. It is shown that soot concentrations on the wings of the flame (where soot formation is dominated by surface chemistry) can be predicted with two of the three mechanisms. However, only the present mechanism with its enhanced PAH growth routes can also predict the correct order of magnitude of soot volume fraction in the low-sooting, inception-dominated, central region of the flame. In applying this chemical mechanism, the parameter α, which describes the portion of soot surface sites that are available for chemical reaction, has been reduced to a theoretically acceptable range, thus improving the quality of the model.}

The employed kinetic model of soot formation, developed and tested earlier for subatmospheric and atmospheric flames, can quantitatively describe the experimental soot volume fraction profiles collected in a number of ehtylene flames at high pressures. The kinetic model consists of initial aromatic ring formation from nonaromatic species, planar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) growth through the hydrogen-abstraction-acetylene-addition reaction mechanism, particle nucleation through coalescence of PAHs, particle growth by coagulation and surface reactions of the forming clusters and particles, and particle oxidation. Analysis of the computational results obtained at 10 bar and additional tests performed for a 1-bar flame suggest that the influence of pressure on soot production arises mainly from the larger concentration of acetylene, which affects both the soot surface growth and the nucleation of soot particles.}

While this structure gives a logical organization to combustion chemistry, the degree to which this organization reflects actual reactive fluxes in flames is not known. Moreover, it has not been tested whether sets of rate parameters derived by optimizing fits to small-hydrocarbon combustion data are secure foundations upon which to optimize the rate parameters needed for modeling the combustion of larger hydrocarbons. In this work, a computer modeling study was undertaken to discover whether optimizing the rate parameters of a 258-reaction C3 combustion chemistry mechanism that was added to a previously optimized 205-reaction C<3 mechanism would provide satisfactory accounting for C3 flame speed and ignition data. The optimization was done with 21 optimization targets, 9 of which were ignition delays and 12 of which were atmospheric pressure laminar flame speeds: 2 of the ignition delays and 2 of the flame speeds, all for methane fuel, had served as optimization targets for the C<3 rate parameters. It was found in sensitivity studies that the coupling between the C3 and the C<3 chemistry was much stronger than anticipated. No set of C3 rate parameters could account for the C3 combustion data as long as the previously optimized (against C<3 optimization targets only) C<3 rate parameters remained fixed. A reasonable match to the C3 targets could be obtained, without degrading the match between experiment and calculation for the C<3 optimization targets, by reoptimizing six of the previously optimized and three additional C<3 rate parameters.}

abstract = {A comprehensive assessment of gas-phase reaction mechanisms and soot models has been performed for atmospheric-pressure laminar ethylene–air flames. Soot modeling is based on a method of moments with interpolative closure. Computed soot volume fractions are compared with experimental measurements for eight flames: four premixed flames from two different burners, and four opposed-flow diffusion flames from two different burners. Seven gas-phase reaction mechanisms have been explored with variations in four key soot model parameters: PAH-based versus acetylene-based nucleation; PAH condensation included versus excluded; surface reactivity steric factor specification; and surface radicals depleted versus conserved. Computed soot volume fractions are most sensitive to variations in the surface reactivity factor and to whether the surface radicals are depleted or conserved. The motivation for this study has been to determine which models should be used for simulations of luminous turbulent flames; there computational efficiency is of paramount importance. A reduced 33-species mechanism together with acetylene-based nucleation, surface reactivity factor variation proposed by [J. Appel, H. Bockhorn, M. Frenklach, Combust. Flame 121 (2000) 122–136], and conserved surface radicals yields acceptable soot volume fractions over a broad range of conditions with an order of magnitude reduction in computational cost compared to a larger 100-species gas-phase reaction mechanism.}

abstract = {A relatively short kinetic mechanism (93 species and 729 reactions) was developed to predict the formation of poly-aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and their growth of up to five aromatic rings in methane and ethane-fueled flames. The model is based on the C0–C2 chemistry with recent well-established chemical kinetic data. Reaction paths for mostly stable and well studied PAH molecules were delineated and the reaction rate constants for PAH growth were collected. These were obtained by analysing the data reported in the literature during the last 30 years, or by using the estimates and optimisations of experimentally measured concentration profiles for small and PAH molecules. These profiles were collected by 12 independent work groups in laminar premixed CH4 and C2H4 flames under atmospheric pressure or in shock tube experiments under elevated pressure. The simulated flame speeds, temporal profiles of small and large aromatics and also soot particles volume fraction data are in good agreement with the experimental data received for different temperatures, mixing ratios and diluents. The extensive analysis of PAH reaction steps showed that the main reaction routes can be conditionally divided into “low temperature” reaction routes, dominating at T<1550K and “high temperature” reaction routes, which contribute mostly to PAH formation at T>1550K. The presented mechanism can be used as the basis for further extensions or reductions applied in kinetic schemes involving PAH and soot production in practical fuel combustion.}

abstract = {Bluff-body stabilized premixed flames have been a subject of significant technological interest in practical combustion devices. A collaborative computational-experimental effort is reported here, on simulating a series of bluff-body stabilized premixed propane flames near lean blowoff. An OpenFOAM-based large eddy simulation (LES) solver is coupled with an adaptive hybrid integration solver with sparse matrix technique, to enable efficient chemistry integration. A 31-species skeletal mechanism matching interested flame characteristics is systematically reduced from USC-Mech II, and is utilized to describe the finite-rate chemistry. A procedure to convert numerical mass fractions to pseudo Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) images is established to facilitate the comparison of flame topology and statistics with corresponding experiments. The study focuses on two stably burning conditions, and subsequently on a condition where global blowoff is observed. Velocity statistics, PLIF images of OH and CH2O, flame brush thickness, turbulent flame speed, and statistics of two dimensional strain rates are compared against experimental data, achieving reasonably good agreement under stably burning conditions. Approaching blowoff, the flame surfaces recede into the recirculation zone due to the reduced flame speed at lower equivalence ratios. Frequent flame-flame interaction in the narrowed necking region near the top boundary of the recirculation zone, asymmetric helical flame structure, and accumulated CH2O in the recirculation zone are observed near blowoff. Elevated levels of unburned fuel is observed in the recirculation zone, suggesting significant entrainment of fresh mixture near global blowoff. Analysis of the enstrophy transport indicates increasing strength of enstrophy approaching blowoff, which results from diminishing baroclinic torque and dilatation effects when density ratios in the anchoring region are reduced.}
